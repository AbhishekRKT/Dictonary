 and its frequency else if word is not present print "NO".
 
To achieve the solution we use trie Data Structure inorder to solve the problem. Tries Data structure is used to implement dictionary because this data structure is very usefull ot find out the solution of this type of college.
We will read the CSV file and store all the value in vector  pair and pass the vector pair in ount function.
