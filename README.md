# Dictonary
In this proble we have given a dictionary and the frequency of each word as input. We have to find word in the dictionary and if the word is present in dictionary then print "YES"
 and its frequency else if word is not present print "NO".
 
To achieve the solution we use trie Data Structure inorder to solve the problem. Tries Data structure is used to implement dictionary because this data structure is very useful ot find out the solution of this type of question.
We will read the CSV file and store all the value in vector  pair and pass the vector pair in out function.




# To run the code ude c++ version 11
Step 1 :- clon the repository.
step 2 :- It is compulsary to install g++ in the system and all hte environment variable is set inorder t oavoid any system error.
step 3:-  with the help of the terminal or cmd go th e Dictionary folder which you have cloned.
step 4:-  Type g++ FindWord .cpp// This is basically used to complete the code.
step 5:-  .\a.exe // code run from from this command.



#Reverse_Search

Given a dictionary. Make a Trie out of that dictionary and mark each end node with numbers starting from 0 to N, where N should be equal to the total number of words in the dictionary.
Now you will be given input from 0 to N. You have to backtrace that node and find the exact
word ending at that node.
